## About This Book

This book transforms the Ubuntu laptop from an ignored device into a superpower tool. Instead of just explaining how things work, it shows kids what they can DO with their computer.

**Target Audience:** Children aged 9-12 who might prefer tablets or gaming consoles but have an Ubuntu laptop available.

**Key Approach:**
- Focus on empowerment and autonomy
- Kids install and customize their own software
- Every chapter answers: "Why should I use this instead of my tablet?"
- Hands-on projects with tangible results
- Simple language, lots of screenshots

## Creation & AI Transparency

This book was created through a collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance:

- **Human Design:** Riccardo Cocetta designed the teaching approach, structure, and philosophy based on research in child development and years of experience in educational technology
- **AI Assistance:** Claude (by Anthropic) helped write the chapters, explanations, and activities under human direction and review
- **Purpose:** To make quality Ubuntu education accessible to children worldwide

We believe in transparency: readers should know when AI tools are used in content creation. What matters most is whether the book effectively teaches kids to use Ubuntu—that's our measure of success.

## Acknowledgments

- AI writing assistance provided by Claude (Anthropic)
- Will be tested with real 9-year-olds for feedback and iteration
- Based on research in child development and computer science education
- Inspired by the open source community's commitment to free knowledge
