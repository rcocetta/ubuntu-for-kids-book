# Ubuntu for Kids: Your Computer, Your Superpower

A Creative Commons book teaching 9-year-olds how to use Ubuntu Linux.

This book transforms the Ubuntu laptop from an ignored device into a superpower tool. Instead of just explaining how things work, it shows kids what they can DO with their computer.

**Target Audience:** Children aged 9-12 who might prefer tablets or gaming consoles but have an Ubuntu laptop available.

**Key Approach:**
- Focus on empowerment and autonomy
- Kids install and customize their own software
- Every chapter answers: "Why should I use this instead of my tablet?"
- Hands-on projects with tangible results
- Simple language, lots of screenshots
