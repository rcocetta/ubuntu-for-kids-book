**After taking all screenshots:**

1. They're in ~/Pictures
2. Rename them to match the filenames in SCREENSHOT-CHECKLIST.md
3. Move them to images/screenshots/
4. Update SCREENSHOT-CHECKLIST.md (change ⬜ to ✅)

**Total time: ~2 hours**

That's it. No automation, no scripts, just take the screenshots.
