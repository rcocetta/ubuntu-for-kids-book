Hey there! Do you have a laptop that just sits on your desk while you use your tablet or gaming console? Does your computer feel boring or confusing? This book is going to change that.

## What This Book Will Teach You

By the time you finish this book, you'll be able to:

- **Create amazing things** like videos, music, artwork, and stories
- **Install any software you want** without asking for help
- **Customize your computer** to look and work exactly how you like
- **Use secret commands** that make you feel like a hacker
- **Fix problems yourself** when something goes wrong
- **Understand how computers actually work** (it's not magic!)

## Why Your Computer Is Better Than a Tablet

I know tablets and gaming consoles are fun. They're great for playing games and watching videos. But here's the thing: those devices are made for *consuming* things other people created.

Your Ubuntu computer is different. It's made for *creating* things. It's a tool that lets YOU be the maker, not just the user.

Think about it:

- On a tablet, you watch videos. On your computer, you **make** videos.
- On a tablet, you play games. On your computer, you **create** games.
- On a console, you follow the rules. On your computer, you **make** the rules.

Your computer gives you superpowers that tablets can't match. It just needs someone to show you how to use them. That's what this book is for.

## What Makes Ubuntu Special

Your computer runs something called **Ubuntu** (pronounced "oo-BOON-too"). It's an operating system, which means it's the main program that makes your computer work.

Ubuntu is special because:

1. **It's free.** Nobody has to pay for it. Ever.
2. **It's yours.** You can change anything you want. No restrictions.
3. **It's safe.** It's really hard for viruses and bad software to mess it up.
4. **It's powerful.** Programmers and scientists use it to do amazing things.

Most importantly, Ubuntu treats you like the boss of your computer. It doesn't hide things from you or lock you out. You're in control.

## How This Book Works

Each chapter will teach you something new. At the end of each chapter, you'll have completed a project or learned a new skill. You'll see:

![Screenshot Placeholder] - Pictures showing you exactly what to do
**Try This!** - Hands-on activities to practice
**What You Learned** - A quick summary of your new skills
**Challenge** - Extra activities if you want to explore more

You don't have to read this book in order. If you want to jump straight to "Installing Software" or "The Terminal," go for it! But if you're just starting out, reading from the beginning will help things make more sense.

## A Note About Mistakes

You're going to make mistakes. That's great! Mistakes are how you learn. Your computer won't explode if you click the wrong button. The worst thing that usually happens is you have to try again.

In Chapter 8, we'll talk about what to do when things go wrong. But for now, just remember: it's okay to experiment. If something doesn't work, you can almost always undo it or try a different way.

## Why This Book Is Free

This book is released under something called a Creative Commons license. That means you can:

- Share it with your friends
- Make copies for your whole school
- Translate it into other languages
- Change it to make it better

The only rules are: don't sell it, give credit to the original author (that's me!), and if you change it, share your version the same way.

Why give it away for free? Because knowledge should be free. If this book helps you learn to use your computer, that's worth more than money.

## About This Book's Creation

This book was created with AI assistance. I (Riccardo Cocetta) designed the approach, structure, and teaching philosophy based on research about how kids learn technology. Then I worked with Claude (an AI by Anthropic) to write the actual chapters, explanations, and activities.

Think of it like this: I'm the architect who designed the building, and AI was the construction crew that helped build it. Every word was reviewed to make sure it's actually helpful for kids learning Ubuntu.

Why mention this? Because transparency matters. You should know how things are made. AI is a tool, just like your computer is a tool. What matters is whether this book helps YOU learn. That's what we care about.
