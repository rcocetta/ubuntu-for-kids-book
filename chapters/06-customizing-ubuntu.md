# Chapter 6: Customizing Ubuntu

Your computer should reflect YOUR personality. Let's make Ubuntu look and work exactly how you want!

## Why Customization Matters

When something is truly yours, you take better care of it and use it more. Customizing your computer makes it feel like YOUR space, not just any old laptop.

Plus, it's fun to see your favorite colors, pictures, and settings every time you use your computer!

## Changing Your Desktop Background

2. Choose "Change Background"
3. Pick from the built-in options, or...
4. Click "Add Picture" to use your own photo

**Method 2: Settings Menu**

1. Click the power menu (top-right)

**Where to find cool wallpapers:**
- Your own photos from the Pictures folder
- Free wallpaper sites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Create your own in GIMP or Drawing!

**Try This!**

Change your wallpaper to:
1. One of the built-in Ubuntu wallpapers
2. A photo of something you love
3. A picture you drew yourself!

## Light Mode vs Dark Mode

![Screenshot Placeholder: Light and dark mode comparison]

**Dark mode** makes everything darker - easier on your eyes, especially at night!

**To switch:**

1. Open Settings
2. Click "Appearance"
3. Choose "Light" or "Dark" under "Style"

**Try both!** Some people love dark mode, others prefer light mode. There's no right answer!

## Changing Your Desktop Colors

Want to make Ubuntu your favorite color?

1. Open Settings
2. Go to "Appearance"
3. Look for "Accent Color"
4. Pick a color you like!

![Screenshot Placeholder: Accent color options]

This changes:
- Highlights and selections
- Some buttons
- Notification colors

**Cool combinations:**
- Dark mode + blue accent = sleek tech look
- Light mode + orange accent = warm and friendly
- Dark mode + green accent = hacker vibe
- Light mode + purple accent = creative energy

## Adjusting Display Settings

### Screen Brightness

**Quick method:**
- Click the power icon (top-right)
- Use the brightness slider

**Settings method:**
1. Settings > Power
2. Adjust "Screen Brightness"

**Tip:** Dim the screen to save battery, brighten it in sunlight!

### Screen Resolution

Resolution is how many pixels (dots) fit on your screen. Higher = sharper!

1. Settings > Displays
2. Choose "Resolution"
3. Pick one that looks good (usually the highest one)

![Screenshot Placeholder: Display settings]

### Night Light

**Night Light** makes your screen warmer (more orange) at night to help you sleep better.

1. Settings > Displays
2. Turn on "Night Light"
3. Set the schedule (sunset to sunrise is good)

**Why this helps:** Blue light from screens can make it harder to fall asleep. Night Light reduces blue light at night.

## Sound Settings

Let's customize your sounds!

### Changing Volume

**Quick way:**
- Click the volume icon (top-right)
- Drag the slider

**Settings way:**
1. Settings > Sound
2. Adjust "Output Volume"

### Changing Sound Effects

Ubuntu plays sounds when you:
- Get notifications
- Empty the trash
- Reach the max volume

**To change these:**

1. Settings > Sound
2. Click "Alert Sound"
3. Choose a different sound
4. Or turn them off if they're annoying

## Customizing the Dock

The **Dock** (the bar on the left with your favorite apps) can be customized!

### Adding Apps to the Dock

1. Open the app you want to add
2. Right-click its icon in the Dock
3. Choose "Add to Favorites"

Now it stays in the Dock even when closed!

### Removing Apps from the Dock

1. Right-click the icon
2. Choose "Remove from Favorites"

- Put your most-used apps at the top!

**Try This!**

Organize your Dock:
1. Remove apps you never use
2. Add your top 5 favorite apps
3. Put them in order from most-used to least-used

### Dock Settings

Want more control?

**Install GNOME Tweaks** (we learned how in Chapter 5!):

1. Open Software Center
2. Search for "GNOME Tweaks"
3. Install it
4. Open Tweaks from Applications

In Tweaks, you can:
- Move the Dock to the bottom

Pick something cool like:

## Power Settings

Control how your computer saves energy:

### Screen Blank Time

### Automatic Suspend
