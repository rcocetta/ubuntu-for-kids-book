## Files and Folders: Where Your Stuff Lives 📂

![Files application window showing the home directory](../images/screenshots/chapter02-files-app.png)

Your computer organizes everything into **files** and **folders**, just like a real filing cabinet 🗄️:

- A **file** 📄 is one thing: a picture 🖼️, a document 📝, a song 🎵
- A **folder** 📁 holds multiple files (and other folders!) - it's like a box 📦 inside a box!

## Understanding Your Files 🔍📄

Every file has a few important properties (like a character in a video game has stats! 🎮):

**Name:** 🏷️ What the file is called (like "vacation-photo.jpg")

**Type:** 🎭 What kind of file it is:

- `.pdf` = Document that looks the same on all computers 📄
- `.odt` = LibreOffice document 📃

**Size:** 📏 How much space it takes up:
- **Bytes (B):** 🤏 Tiny (a few letters)
- **Kilobytes (KB):** 📄 Small (a page of text)
- **Megabytes (MB):** 📸 Medium (a photo or song)
- **Gigabytes (GB):** 🎥 Large (a movie or video game)

**Try This!** 🕵️

Let's look at a file's properties (detective work time!):

1. Open Files 📂
2. Click on "Documents" 📚
3. Right-click on any file 🖱️ (or create a new folder if it's empty)
4. Choose "Properties" 📋
