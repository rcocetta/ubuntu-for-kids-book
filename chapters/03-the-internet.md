# Chapter 3: The Internet

The Internet is one of the coolest things about having a computer. Let's learn how to use it safely and powerfully!

## What Is the Internet?

![The Internet is millions of computers connected together](../images/illustrations/internet-network.svg)

The **Internet** is millions of computers all connected together, sharing information. When you go to a website, your computer asks another computer (called a server) to send you a web page.

Think of it like a giant library where:
- Every website is a book
- Your computer is like you walking into the library
- Your browser is like your ability to read
- URLs (web addresses) are like call numbers telling you where to find each book

## Meet Firefox: Your Web Browser

![Screenshot Placeholder: Firefox browser window]

**Firefox** is your web browser. It's the program that shows you websites. Let's open it:

1. Click "Show Applications"
2. Click the Firefox icon (or type "firefox")

### Parts of Firefox

![Browser window showing the address bar, tabs, buttons, and content area](../images/illustrations/browser-parts.svg)

**Address Bar:** Where you type web addresses (URLs)
**Tabs:** Open multiple websites at once
**Back/Forward Buttons:** Go to previous or next pages
**Refresh Button:** Reload the current page
**Home Button:** Go to your home page
**Bookmarks:** Save your favorite websites
**Menu (Three Lines):** More options and settings

**Try This!**

Let's visit a website:

1. Click in the address bar
2. Type: `ubuntu.com`
3. Press Enter
4. You're now on Ubuntu's official website!

![Screenshot Placeholder: ubuntu.com loaded]

## How Web Addresses Work

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address. Here's how to read one:

```
https://www.ubuntu.com/download
│      │   │         │  │
│      │   │         │  └─ The specific page
│      │   │         └──── The website name
│      │   └───────────── "www" (world wide web)
│      └──────────────── The protocol (how computers talk)
└─────────────────────── Secure connection
```

**Important Parts:**
- `https://` means secure connection (data is encrypted)
- `http://` means NOT secure (avoid entering passwords here!)
- `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu` are top-level domains

**Try This!**

Visit these safe websites:
- `duckduckgo.com` - A search engine
- `archive.org` - The Internet Archive with old websites and books
- `khanacademy.org` - Free learning videos

## Searching the Internet

You don't need to know every website's address. Use a **search engine** to find things!

### Using DuckDuckGo

![Screenshot Placeholder: DuckDuckGo homepage]

DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn't track what you search for (more private!).

1. Go to `duckduckgo.com`
2. Type what you want to find
3. Press Enter
4. Click on any result to visit that website

**Search Tips:**

Use **quotes** for exact phrases:
- `"solar system"` finds pages with those exact words together

Use **-** to exclude words:
- `jaguar -car` finds the animal, not the car brand

Use **site:** to search one website:
- `site:khanacademy.org fractions` finds fraction videos on Khan Academy

**Try This!**

Search for:
1. Your favorite animal
2. "how to draw" plus something you like
3. A recipe for your favorite food

## Tabs: Multiple Websites at Once

![Screenshot Placeholder: Firefox with multiple tabs]

**Tabs** let you have many websites open at the same time without cluttering your screen.

**To open a new tab:**
- Click the + button next to your current tab
- Or press `Ctrl + T`

**To close a tab:**
- Click the X on the tab
- Or press `Ctrl + W`

**To switch between tabs:**
- Click on the tab you want
- Or press `Ctrl + Tab`

**Try This!**

1. Open three tabs
2. Go to a different website in each tab
3. Practice switching between them
4. Close one tab

## Bookmarks: Saving Your Favorites

When you find a website you like, **bookmark** it so you can find it again easily!

![Screenshot Placeholder: Bookmarks menu]

**To bookmark a page:**
1. While on the page you like, click the menu (three lines)
2. Choose "Bookmark Page"
3. Or press `Ctrl + D`

**To see your bookmarks:**
1. Click the menu
2. Choose "Bookmarks"
3. Click on any bookmark to visit that site

**Try This!**

1. Find a website you like
2. Bookmark it
3. Close the tab
4. Open your bookmarks and click it to go back

## Staying Safe Online

The Internet is mostly great, but you need to know how to stay safe!

### The Rules of Internet Safety

**1. Never Share Personal Information**

Don't tell strangers online:
- Your full name, address, or phone number
- Your school's name
- Where you hang out
- When you'll be home alone

**2. Ask Before Creating Accounts**

Many websites want you to create an account. Always ask a parent first because you need to:
- Provide an email address
- Agree to terms of service (rules)
- Sometimes provide payment information

**3. Tell an Adult About Weird Stuff**

If you see something that makes you uncomfortable:
- Mean comments or bullying
- Scary or inappropriate content
- Someone asking to meet in person
- Requests for personal information

→ Tell a trusted adult immediately!

**4. Use Strong Passwords**

If you have accounts, use strong passwords:
- At least 10 characters long
- Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
- Don't use your name or birthday
- Don't use the same password everywhere

**5. Think Before You Click**

Some links and downloads can be harmful:
- Don't click suspicious links
- Don't download things without permission
- Don't click on ads that seem too good to be true
- If it seems weird, don't click it!

**6. Remember: The Internet Is Forever**

Anything you post online might stay there forever. Before sharing a photo, video, or comment, ask yourself: "Would I be okay with everyone seeing this?"

### Spotting Fake Websites

Sometimes bad people create fake websites to trick you. Warning signs:

❌ The URL looks weird (like `g00gle.com` instead of `google.com`)
❌ The website asks for passwords or credit cards right away
❌ Lots of pop-ups and flashing ads
❌ The address bar doesn't show `https://` (no secure connection)
❌ Too many spelling mistakes

✅ **Real websites:**
- Have proper URLs
- Look professional
- Don't bombard you with pop-ups
- Use `https://` (look for the padlock icon)

## Using Email Basics

**Email** lets you send messages to other people over the Internet. Each person has an email address that looks like this:

```
username@example.com
│        │ │
│        │ └─ The email service
│        └─── The @ symbol
└───────────── The person's username
```

### Common Email Services

- Gmail (by Google)
- Outlook/Hotmail (by Microsoft)
- ProtonMail (very private)
- Yahoo Mail

You access email through a web browser (go to gmail.com, for example) or through an email app.

**Email Safety:**

- Don't open emails from people you don't know
- Don't click links in suspicious emails
- Don't reply to spam (junk email)
- If an email seems too good to be true, it probably is!
- Never share your email password with anyone except your parents

## Downloading Files

Sometimes you'll want to **download** things from the Internet - save a file to your computer.

**Safe things to download:**
- Pictures from trusted websites
- Documents from school or teachers
- Open-source software from official websites
- Free educational resources

**Be careful with:**
- Programs and apps (ask first!)
- Files from unknown websites
- Email attachments from strangers
- Anything that promises free money, games, or prizes

**Where downloads go:**

By default, files you download go to your **Downloads** folder. To find them:

1. Open Files
2. Click "Downloads" in the sidebar
3. Your downloaded files are there!
