# Chapter 4: Creating Things

This is where the magic happens! Your computer isn't just for watching and playing - it's for MAKING. Let's create awesome stuff!

## Why Creating Is More Fun Than Consuming

On a tablet, you watch videos. On your computer, you **make** them.

On a console, you play games. On your computer, you **create** them.

On a phone, you scroll through pictures. On your computer, you **draw** them.

Creators have more fun than consumers. Plus, when you make something, you can share it with others and feel proud!

## Writing: LibreOffice Writer

**What are spreadsheets good for?**
- Keeping track of scores
- Making lists
- Doing lots of math at once
- Creating charts and graphs
- Organizing collections (like game stats or card collections)

**Basic Spreadsheet Skills:**

**Cells:** Each box is a cell (like A1, B2, C3)
**Rows:** Go across (numbered 1, 2, 3...)
**Columns:** Go up and down (lettered A, B, C...)

**Try This - Make a Game Score Tracker:**

1. Open Calc
2. In cell A1, type "Game"
3. In cell B1, type "Score"
4. In cell C1, type "Date"
5. Fill in your favorite games and high scores!

![Screenshot Placeholder: Simple spreadsheet example]

**Cool Calc Trick - Automatic Math:**

Type `=5+3` in a cell and press Enter. It calculates it for you!

You can use:

- **My Videos** (for video projects)
- **My Music** (for audio recordings)
- **School Projects** (for homework)

This makes finding your stuff easy!

**Tip:** Name your files clearly:
- Good: `story-about-dragons-2026.odt`
- Bad: `untitled1.odt`
