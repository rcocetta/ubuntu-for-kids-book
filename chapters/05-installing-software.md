# Chapter 5: Installing Software (Building Your Toolkit)

Here's where things get really exciting. YOU get to decide what software goes on YOUR computer. It's like building your own custom toolkit with exactly the tools you need!

## Why This Is a Superpower

On most tablets and gaming consoles, someone else decides what apps you can use. But on Ubuntu, YOU are in charge. You can:

- Install any software you want (with permission, of course)
- Try new programs whenever you're curious
- Remove programs you don't like
- Customize your computer to work exactly how you want

This is REAL control. This is YOUR computer doing what YOU want.
