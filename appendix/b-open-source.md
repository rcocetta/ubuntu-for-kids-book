# Appendix B: What Is Open Source?

You've been using Ubuntu, which is "open source." But what does that actually mean?

## The Big Idea

**Open source** means the source code (the instructions that make software work) is available for anyone to:

- **See** - Read how it works
- **Use** - Run it for free
- **Change** - Modify it to work better for you
- **Share** - Give copies to others

It's like a recipe that anyone can read, improve, and share!

## Source Code: The Recipe

Think of software like a cake:

**Closed source (proprietary):**
- You get the cake
- You can eat it
- But you can't see the recipe
- You can't change the ingredients
- You can't bake your own

**Open source:**
- You get the cake
- You can eat it
- The recipe is included!
- You can change the recipe
- You can bake more and share them

**Source code** is the recipe. It's the human-readable instructions that programmers write. Your computer turns it into working software.

## Why Open Source?

### Freedom

You're not locked in. Don't like how something works? Change it! Can't afford expensive software? Get the free version!

### Security

Thousands of people can check the code for problems. More eyes = safer software. No hidden spy features!

### Learning

Want to learn programming? Read real code! See how actual programs work. Learn from the best!

### Community

People worldwide work together. Share ideas, fix bugs, add features. No single company controls it.

### Quality

When everyone can see the code:
- Bad code gets noticed and fixed
- Good ideas get adopted quickly
- Competition makes things better

## Open Source vs Free Software

Are they the same? Almost!

**Free Software** (as defined by the Free Software Foundation):
- Emphasizes **freedom** and **ethics**
- Free = Freedom (liberty), not free (zero cost)
- About your rights as a user

**Open Source:**
- Emphasizes **practical benefits**
- Better development method
- Higher quality software
- Focus on technical excellence

**In practice:** Most software is both! Ubuntu is free software AND open source.

**"Free as in freedom, not free as in beer"** - Richard Stallman

Both are free ($0), but the important part is your freedom to use, study, modify, and share.

## GNU/Linux: Ubuntu's Foundation

Ubuntu is built on **Linux**, which is built on **GNU**. What are these?

### Linux

**Linux** is the **kernel** - the core of the operating system. It talks to your hardware.

- Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991
- Started as a hobby project
- Now runs everything from phones to supercomputers
- Completely open source

**Fun fact:** Linux powers:
- Most websites (web servers)
- All Android phones
- Smart TVs
- Rockets and spacecraft
- Supercomputers
- Your Wi-Fi router

### GNU

**GNU** (GNU's Not Unix) is a collection of essential software tools.

- Started by Richard Stallman in 1983
- Provides the programs that make Linux usable
- The compiler that builds other software
- Many command-line tools

**Technically correct name:** GNU/Linux (GNU tools + Linux kernel)

**What people say:** "Linux" (it's shorter!)

### Ubuntu's Place

```
GNU Tools
    ↓
  Linux Kernel
    ↓
  Ubuntu
    ↓
Your Computer!
```

Ubuntu takes GNU and Linux, adds:
- Easy installer
- Nice desktop (GNOME)
- Software Center
- Good defaults
- Regular updates
- User-friendly features

That's why Ubuntu is easier to use than "just Linux"!

## Open Source Licenses

Not all open source is exactly the same. **Licenses** define the rules.

### Common Licenses

**GPL (General Public License):**
- Very free
- If you change it, you must share your changes
- Used by Linux, many GNU tools
- "Copyleft" - keeps software free forever

**MIT License:**
- Very simple
- Do almost anything you want
- Just give credit to original authors
- Used by many libraries and tools

**Apache License:**
- Similar to MIT
- Extra protection for users
- Used by Android, lots of Google projects

**Creative Commons:**
- For non-software content (books, art, music)
- This book uses CC BY-NC-SA!
- Multiple variants (different permissions)

### Why Licenses Matter

They protect:
- Your freedom to use the software
- The original creator's credit
- The ability to improve the software
- The community's shared work

Without licenses, it's unclear what you can do!

## Famous Open Source Projects

You're using open source all the time, even if you didn't know!

## How Open Source Gets Made

Who makes all this free software?

### Volunteers

Many people contribute for free because:
- They love it
- They're learning
- They want to give back
- It's their hobby
- They believe in freedom

### Companies

Businesses pay developers to work on open source:
- **Red Hat** (owned by IBM) - Employs Linux developers
- **Canonical** - Makes Ubuntu
- **Google** - Funds Chromium, Android
- **Microsoft** - Yes, even Microsoft contributes to open source now!

### Universities

Research projects often release code as open source:
- Advances science
- Others can verify results
- Collaboration improves research

### Foundations

Non-profit organizations support projects:
- **Linux Foundation** - Supports Linux development
- **Free Software Foundation** - Promotes software freedom
- **Mozilla Foundation** - Makes Firefox
- **Apache Foundation** - Maintains Apache projects

## Getting Involved

You can contribute to open source too!

### As a Kid

**You don't need to be a programmer!**

**Test software:**
- Try new programs
- Report bugs you find
- Suggest features

**Write documentation:**
- Help files
- Tutorials
- Explain things to beginners

**Translate:**
- Know another language?
- Translate software or documentation

**Create artwork:**
- Icons, logos, themes
- Many projects need designers

**Spread the word:**
- Blog about software you like
- Make tutorial videos
- Help others learn

### As You Learn Programming

When you know how to code:
- Fix small bugs
- Add small features
- Improve documentation with code examples
- Create your own open source projects!

## Open Source Success Stories

### Linux

Started as one student's hobby. Now runs most of the Internet and billions of devices.

### Wikipedia

Open knowledge. Anyone can contribute. Largest encyclopedia ever.

### Firefox

Prevented Internet Explorer monopoly. Pushed browser innovation. Still fighting for privacy.

### Blender

Free 3D software that rivals $3000+ commercial tools. Used in Spider-Verse movie!

### Raspberry Pi

## The Opposite: Closed Source

To understand open source, know what it's NOT:

**Closed source (proprietary) software:**
- **Can't see the code** - It's secret
- **Can't modify it** - Against the rules
- **Can't share it** - Illegal to copy
- **Costs money** - Usually
- **Company controls it** - They decide features

Examples:
- Windows (mostly)
- macOS (mostly)
- Adobe Photoshop
- Microsoft Office
- Most video games

**Note:** Some closed source software is good! It's not evil. But open source gives you more freedom.

## Why This Matters to You

**You're using open source RIGHT NOW:**
- Ubuntu - Open source
- LibreOffice - Open source
- Firefox - Open source
- Most apps you installed - Open source

**Benefits you get:**
- **Free:** Save hundreds of dollars
- **Freedom:** Customize everything
- **Privacy:** No secret tracking
- **Learning:** See how it works
- **Community:** Join millions of users
- **Future:** Skills that matter in tech

**You're part of something bigger:**

You're not just a consumer. You're part of a global community that believes:
- Knowledge should be shared
- Software should be free
- Users should have control
- Cooperation beats competition
